# Solenoid_optimization
The algorithm takes in the physical and geometrical parameters that define a solenoid and outputs the strength of the magnetic fields it can generate as a function of its total size. This algorithm facilitates the identification of optimal solenoid geometries for a given conductive material, elemental geometry, and available power.
