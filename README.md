# Solenoid_optimization
Written in Matlab, this algorithm takes in the physical and geometrical parameters that define a 3D-printed stacked solenoid and outputs the strength of the magnetic fields it can generate as a function of its total sizeâ€”either in terms of its dimensions in millimeters or the number of in-plane loops and stacked layers it contains. This algorithm facilitates the identification of solenoid sizes expected to yield the highest magnetic fields for a given conductive material, elemental geometry, and available power. It approximates each loop of the spirals that comprise the solenoids as circles and iterates over them to compute their contribution to the total magnetic field. The algorithm also computes the total resistance of the device to determine whether it can operate at the maximum electric current that the material can withstand, or if power constraints require the applied current to be reduced, resulting in the generation of weaker magnetic fields.
